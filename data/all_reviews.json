My mother has been here twice due to heart failure and liver failure. First time she was placed on the cardiac floor 10 and while on meds Teresa came into her room and had my mother sign a DNR form. Teresa also came and spoke to me about the form and through the entire conversation my mom was unconscious due to her meds she was on and was trying to push me to have my mother put into hospice care. I had told her I was not ready for that yet and I wanted to see how my mom progressed. My mother was released to a rehabilitation facility for three days then ended right back at the hospital due to her meds not being given to her correctly. Then my mother was out in the CCU unit where she was kept on a dopamine drip for days. One day the Drs say she has three months at most, next day she has a year, next day from Teresa she says my mother is gonna die any day. Finally after the constant lack of communication and miscommunication from this hospital I had to tell the Drs to get their stuff straightened out and figure out what they're going to do because if they're too incompetent here then I wanted my mom transferred to Tulsa. So then it's she's getting a pacemaker so I take another day off from work to be with her, then I come in only to find out no pacemaker! The back and forth from the Drs here is enough to drive anyone crazy! Having that Teresa lady constantly harassing us for hospice care and for harassment of us deciding to reverse my mother's DNR is shocking and disgusting!! I also wrote my name and phone number on my mother's white board in every room she was in for daily phone calls and communication from the Drs or nurses, not one time did anyone bother to call me!! Only good employee we encountered is  Tamela, she is always so nice and beyond helpful. That Teresa lady should be fired!!! Cardiologist here are extremely unprofessional and beyond dumb!!!",

I could barely walk or see when I was brought in. From the very beginning I felt like a complete inconvenience their staff. Barely conscious I had to fill out paperwork before I could even be seen by anyway. I can\u2019t recall how long I waited but I remember sitting there in so much pain throwing up into a trash can. Note: There was no one in the lobby. During the entire visit I had to suffer with rude and inconsiderate nurses who treated me like I was completely fine. There were so many incidents of neglect and impatience. I don\u2019t feel comfortable going into complete detail about everything, but one of the most notable parts was when I had used my call button to ask what was happening or if I had any friends or family there. I was so scared and confused. The nurse responded with \u201cI don\u2019t know I don\u2019t check the cameras.\u201d They took my call button away and left for me with nothing for so long (I didn\u2019t have my cell phone or anything on me) After being told I was discharged after an hour of not seeing anyone they gave me papers and didn\u2019t even walk me out or show me to the  lobby or exit. My loved ones watched me stumble into the lobby barely being able to see with no help or assistance from anyone. No one informed them of my state, or condition the entire time. Overall it was a terrible experience where I felt neglected, unheard, and disrespected in my most vulnerable state.",
