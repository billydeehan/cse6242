The nurse and Dr. Landon Vinson were incredible one of the best doctors I\u2019ve been to or experienced ever. Very knowledgeable and makes sure you are completely taken care of I very much appreciated it! Thank you to all staff for making the experience much better than it could\u2019ve been. Will definitely not hesitate to come back if in need of anything they are the absolute best!!! :)",

She has been there numerous times and nearly EVERY time the staff has brought her to literal tears with their inconsideration and rudeness. I even calmly voiced my displeasure to the nurse in charge one night and was firmly escorted by security from the building. Tonight it was due to complications from Corona Virus and she was treated very poorly because of her personal decision to not be vaccinated.  Vaccination is a choice and patients should NOT be treated like less than normal because of a personal choice!!! Shame on you!!!",

THANK YOU SO MUCH to all the nurses in the ICU. They have been so patient with me and I call A LOT! They are always so kind and helpful, and I am so thankful to them for taking such good care of my boyfriend while he is sick. He means the world to me, and it makes it especially hard that I can\u2019t be there with him. I am going to have to send some gift baskets or something to show the nurses how much I appreciate them! I have never been to coffeyville myself but I wish I could, just to meet and thank every one of the nurses that have been taking such good care of Chris Austin. Thank you all so much.",

We went back about 15 to 20 mins after arriving.  The rest of the docs and nurse were great but no one seem in that big of a hurry with the exception of a few.  The room I was in was dirty trash under the bed and all three trash bins so full you could close the lid.  The admissions lady was just plan unpleasant.",

Ended up going in yesterday morning and was sent home within 20 mins without even being checked out. Ended up driving to Bartlesville Oklahoma to the hospital there and with in 3 hours diagnosed me. And treated me!! this hospital is a joke. I would highly recommend going to Bartlesville or any other facility especially if your life depends on it. Then they make you sign paperwork to cover their screw ups. Be aware of this facility. Again don't go there even if you think your dying!!!",
