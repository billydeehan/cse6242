She had a appointment with her specialist today only to find out her water had broke. Do not trust this hospital and they better pray my daughter and grand-baby are okay after they did not provide adequate health care. Daughter is currently on her way to a real hospital!",

I had a minimal stay & nothing more than was necessary. Dr's follow up instructions were explained point by point. My preconceived notions of professional medical staff were proven so wrong. But then I behaved as an adult. Not the werewolf children who leave negative comments on this facility. Thanks Dr Meister and all others in your staff Joe . . .",

Doctor Bryan only pretends to care for you on an emergency room visits that costs you thousands, won't help you unless you come in to the emergency room and then nothing. He will have a young nurse take your blood pressure, weigh your weight on the weight scale and that's about it. My Father is 63 years old and him and I have given this Hospital and Doctors many chances to do better and nothing changes! Wouldn't take a family member here again or a stranger. This Hospital should be closed if that's the best Doctors they can hire or find!",

I understand the people in the lobby that were there before me got pulled back before me. But when people that came after me were taken back I started asking questions. The ladies up front were great although they didn\u2019t have a lot of information as to why I was still sitting there. I really hope this is the status quo for EMERGENCY care.",
