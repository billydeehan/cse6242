                    "review_text": "Where should I start? Rude and lazy nurses, confused cardiologists, lack of care or communication, or Teresa that goes around pushing for DNR and hospice? My mother has been here twice due to heart failure and liver failure. First time she was placed on the cardiac floor 10 and while on meds Teresa came into her room and had my mother sign a DNR form. Teresa also came and spoke to me about the form and through the entire conversation my mom was unconscious due to her meds she was on and was trying to push me to have my mother put into hospice care. I had told her I was not ready for that yet and I wanted to see how my mom progressed. My mother was released to a rehabilitation facility for three days then ended right back at the hospital due to her meds not being given to her correctly. Then my mother was out in the CCU unit where she was kept on a dopamine drip for days. One day the Drs say she has three months at most, next day she has a year, next day from Teresa she says my mother is gonna die any day. Finally after the constant lack of communication and miscommunication from this hospital I had to tell the Drs to get their stuff straightened out and figure out what they're going to do because if they're too incompetent here then I wanted my mom transferred to Tulsa. So then it's she's getting a pacemaker so I take another day off from work to be with her, then I come in only to find out no pacemaker! The back and forth from the Drs here is enough to drive anyone crazy! Having that Teresa lady constantly harassing us for hospice care and for harassment of us deciding to reverse my mother's DNR is shocking and disgusting!! I also wrote my name and phone number on my mother's white board in every room she was in for daily phone calls and communication from the Drs or nurses, not one time did anyone bother to call me!! Only good employee we encountered is  Tamela, she is always so nice and beyond helpful. That Teresa lady should be fired!!! Cardiologist here are extremely unprofessional and beyond dumb!!!",

Two hours in the waiting room then once you go back to a room in ER it\u2019s at least another 2 hours waiting for any testing to be completed. We have been here twice in the past 45 days for two different situations. Once the initial evaluation and routine monitors/ blood work has been done, no one comes back the room to give any updates or at least let you know you haven\u2019t been forgotten. I realize it\u2019s probably understaffed for the amount of people that routinely come in and it\u2019s not the staff\u2019s fault as they all are busy seeing other patients. It seems to us that it would be a nice touch for someone to take less than a minute to say \u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten about you we are just really busy, are you doing ok?\u201d  Just our thoughts.",

I call every week, am put on hold, they take down my information and tell me they will \"call me right back\" and never do.  I have put messages on the portal for them, even included my MRI results and no response.  The referral was due to the results of an MRI I had at the beginning of August that revealed an issue that needs attention and could become very serious if not attended to.   I am extremely frustrated as I need to get in to see them as soon as possible.  Am at a loss as to what to do except keep calling every week.

I feel like this could of been prevented if that doctor would have worried about my mom instead of asking questions he already knew the answers to and even answering his own questions. Absolutely ridiculous I'll never use this hospital again after ALL this!!!",
